# Simple Mau Mau

## What is Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is a card game of an origin currently unknown to me (and unresearched by me!) that is common in Germany. The goal is to get rid of all your cards before the opponent(s) do so.

### Basic rules
Mau Mau is played clockwise, with each player playing out a card following a set of rules. If a player can't play, s/he must take one card, if s/he still can't play, it's the next player's turn. If you don't want to play, you must not, but you must draw a card then. :-)

If you've played your second to the last card, you must announce "Mau!" to the other players. If you don't and the next person has played his/her card, you draw 2 cards as a penalty.

Special cards:
* Seven: Next player draws 2 cards, unless s/he can extend with another 7, so the following player draws 4 cards, and so forth.
* Eight: Next player is skipped
* Nine: The direction of play is reversed (optional rule - not common)
* Jack: Request a colour from the next player (Diamond, Heart, Spade, Club). Can't be played on another jack!

## What is this project about?
This is my very first JavaScript project and I use it as a playground and experimental toy.
