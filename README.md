# Simple Mau Mau

## What is Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is a card game of an origin currently unknown to me (and unresearched by me!) that is common in Germany. The goal is to get rid of all your cards before the opponent(s) do so.

## What is this project about?
This is my very first JavaScript project and I use it as a playground and experimental toy.

## Image License
The card images are taken from the American Contract Bridge League, which offers them free to download on their website: http://acbl.mybigcommerce.com/52-playing-cards/

Should they be used in error or against any license, kindly inform me, I will replace them.
